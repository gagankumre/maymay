The project focuses upon providing an exclusive platform to youngsters where they can create and "consume" memes. The app tries to maximize comfort and usefulness by a simple user friendly interface solely focusing upon memes. We also have strong bias towards selective content consumption which will be implemented by absolute categorization of memes. Memes are one of the biggest trends in this modern society in domains of social networking. We are also planning to provide easy to go templates in the app itself which will ease the difficulty experienced by beginners in creating their first memes in our future updates.
